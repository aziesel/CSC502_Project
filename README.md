# CSC502_Project
Repository detailing the CSC502 project work conducted by Finn Archinuk, Ezra MacDonald and Alison Ziesel.

Index:


notebooks/apply_louvain_toy.ipynb: Our PySpark Louvain implementation applied to the Les Misérables character interaction network. This implementation uses primitive types to define nodes, clusters and edges.

notebooks/arxiv clustering (reduced authors).ipynb: Our Threaded Louvain implementation applied to the arXiv data set.

notebooks/cluster_computations.ipynb: Explorations of Node and Cluster classes for our algorithm implementation, as well as the use of RDD versus Dataframe data structures.

notebooks/graph_frames.ipynb: Exploration of using the Graphframes library to aid in our network graph analysis. 

notebooks/cu_graph_louvain.ipynb: Exploration of using the  Node and Cluster classes for our algorithm implementation.

notebooks/les_mis.py: Definition of the Les Misérables character interaction network. Network nodes are characters, edges are interactions weighted by the number of times those two characters interacted in the novel.

notebooks/louvain.ipynb: Explorations of Node and Cluster classes for our algorithm implementation, as well as the use of RDD versus Dataframe data structures.

notebooks/mod_map_louvain.ipynb: Testing of RDDs for our later Louvain implementations.

notebooks/toy_network_and_data_preprocessing.ipynb: This notebook details the analysis of the Les Misérables network with the non-distributed 'python-louvain' library, as well as the preprocessing done to convert the ArXiv metadata into a coauthorship network.
